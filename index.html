            <p class='p'>
              The data types shown in the stacked bar chart include categorical attributes "A,B,C, and D". This data type is shown in the visualization through the mark of area of the whole rectangle. The viewer can see the area/length of the rectangle correlates with a number provided on the y-axis of the visualization. There is another presumed categorical attribute (of which there is four options) that is prevalent is each that is displayed through the channel of color differentation, although no label is prevalent to give the user further information on what the categorical attribute is. Each of these subcategories also is displayed with the get of a mark of area/length of the total rectangle of its parent attribute.

          <div class="item">
            <img src="/hw-03-a1/img/mind_map.png" alt="Mind Map" width="350" height="200">
            <p class='p'>
              The data types shown in the mind map include categorical attributes and links between items. In this example, the items each have an attribute of either "Idea", "Theme", or "Category" and that is how they are represented in the mind map. Marks in this type of visualization include lines that show the links between each item (represented by text) in a parent/child format. Channels include color. Position is not a channel in this case as there does not seem to be a defining order of where the attributes are besides the link of relationship to parent/child.

          <div class="item">
            <img src="/hw-03-a1/img/bump_chart.png" alt="Bump Chart" width="350" height="200">
            <p class='p'>
              The data types shown in the bump chart above are the attributes time and rank (both sequential ordinal attributes). There is also the categorical attribute "A,B,C,D, and E". Items are shown in the visualization through marks including lines and points. Connection is another type of mark used in this example as it is used as a link between category and rank over time. The channels that are used are  color of both points and lines, position in both directions for the points, and tilt of the lines.

          <div class="item">
            <img src="/hw-03-a1/img/bubble_and_pie_chart.png" alt="Bubble and Pie Chart" width="350" height="200">
            <p class='p'>
              The data types shown in the bubble and pie chart image represent four attributes. The first two are sequential attributes represented by the x-axis and the y-axis, however they are not labeled so the specific attributes are unknown to the user. Marks are in the form of pie charts on the graph. The channels that are used include the, size of the pies, as well as the percentages that the pies are split into.
